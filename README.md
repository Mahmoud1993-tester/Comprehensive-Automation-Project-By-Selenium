# 🧪 Automated Testing Project for Demo E-commerce Website

This project automates different user workflows on the demo e-commerce website [AutomationExercise.com](https://www.automationexercise.com/) using **Selenium WebDriver**, **TestNG**, and the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern in **Java**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build a reliable and scalable automated testing framework that validates various functionalities on a demo e-commerce site, simulating real-world user interactions and catching UI or workflow-related issues.

---

## 🔍 Modules Covered

The following features have been tested and automated so far:

- ✅ Sign-Up workflow
- ✅ Account creation and validation
- ✅ Address input and checkbox selections
- ✅ Logging in and logging out
- 🛒 More modules (e.g., Add to Cart, Product Search, Checkout) are in progress...

## 🧠 Real-World Challenges Encountered

While working on this project, I tackled several practical issues:

- ❗ `AssertionError` when validating success messages
- 🎯 Elements not interactable without scrolling
- 🔍 Unexpected DOM structure changes (e.g., tag mismatches)

---

## 🔧 How I Solved Them

- Used `JavaScriptExecutor` to scroll and interact with dynamic elements
- Added `System.out.println()` logs to trace flow and element text
- Applied the **Page Object Model** to keep the project maintainable and modular

---

## 🔨 Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **Testing Framework**: TestNG  
- **Automation Tool**: Selenium WebDriver  
- **Design Pattern**: Page Object Model (POM)  
- **Browser Driver**: ChromeDriver  
- **Debugging Tools**: Console logs, DOM Inspector
